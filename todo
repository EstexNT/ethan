~ keep the zero/one registers as constants, do not allow overwriting of them
- convert ugly big switch cases into tables (like in compare.cpp)
- preferably have a separate thing for formats and for execution?
- prettify the `if (cpu->branched) {return;}`'s littered in code (related to #2)
    - maybe make the Handle functions return a func ptr which will be put into an array which then will be executed 
~ convert this whole thing to system emulation
