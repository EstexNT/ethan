~ keep the zero/one registers as constants, do not allow overwriting of them
~ revamp code
    ~ convert ugly big switch cases into tables 
    ~ preferably have a separate thing for formats and for execution?
    ~ prettify the `if (cpu->branched) {return;}`'s littered in code 
        ~ maybe make the Handle functions return a func ptr which will be put into an array which then will be executed 
- separate disassembly and execution
~ convert this whole thing to system emulation
